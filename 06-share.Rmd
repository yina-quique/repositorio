The steps are as follows to learn a new sentence:

## Listen {#cross_6}
*Listen* to the sentence by clicking icon ![](images/play_icon.png) Listen WITHOUT speaking. 

## Listen and point
Listen to the sentence again by clicking the icon ![](images/play_icon.png) *As you listen*, point with your finger to each word of the written sentence.

## Together
Try saying the sentence *simultaneously * with the video. Do this step **twice.**  For this, you will need to click the icon again ![](images/play_icon.png)

## You 
Try saying the sentence *without* help from the video.

## Rate
Rate your production using the *following options*:

- Again = “I didn't do it very well and I need to do it again.”

- Difficult = “I did it more or less”

- Good = “I did well”

- Easy = Ignore this option for now

## Important! If it is a sentence you have **already** seen, BEFORE [step 1](#cross_6), try to remember the sentence with the help of the image.

## The steps described here are *based on scientific evidence* from a treatment called Script Training.
