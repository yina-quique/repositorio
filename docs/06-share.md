## You 
Try saying the sentence *without* help from the video.

## Rate
Rate your production using the *following options*:

- Again = “I didn't do it very well and I need to do it again.”

- Difficult = “I did it more or less”

- Good = “I did well”

- Easy = Ignore this option for now

## Important! If it is a sentence you have **already** seen, BEFORE [step 1](#cross_6), try to remember the sentence with the help of the image.
