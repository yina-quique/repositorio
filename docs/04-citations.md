## Click on sync.


## Enter your email and password. [The ones you created previously in 4.2](#cross_3).


## Download the repository.

*Note:* We tried to make gender-neutral sentences in Spanish (grammatically speaking), but some sentences have grammatical gender markers (e.g., estoy preocupad**a** vs. Estoy preocupad**o**).

There are two files: one with feminine gender markers and one with masculine gender markers. For example, the feminine file has sentences like *estoy tranquila* and the masculine file has sentences like *me siento solo.* 

Still, the differences between these two files are minimal since most of the sentences are shared. **Select the file with which you identify yourself and download it to your computer.**  

## Double click the file you downloaded.

It will take a few minutes to download and synchronize. Have patience. 


## If you see this prompt while synchronizing, select the “Upload to AnkiWeb” option. {-}

## You are ready!

Once it *finishes synchronizing,* the repository will be ready to be used.

The next step is optional and involves synchronizing the repository on your tablet or phone. You can practice on the computer, tablet, or both.

If you don't want or need to use your tablet or phone to practice, then skip to [how to practice sentences.](#cross_5)
